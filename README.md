#Dark Mist

The Mist Town was gone. It all happened decades ago, the town was reduced to ruins in a fire, which took away some lives and drove others out of the town, and left a thick dark mist that has been covering the town all these years. Since then, people have called it the Mist Town .

The mist left the town barren, but it did not stop some adventurers, since legend has it that the Mist Town was left with priceless treasures as the result of that fire. However, those who have been to the Mist Town have never returned. Are they obessed with the treasures there, or are they trapped?

Frank is one of them, and now he sets off without fear.

Can he succeed?
